# mysensors-opentherm
Mysensors opentherm gateway

Effectively a open of http://otgw.tclcode.com, but with external power brick and a MYSX-2.0 connector instead of the RS-232 interface. The PCB is designed to fit in [this](http://www.ebay.com/itm/221899779029) enclosure and connect to https://github.com/dirkjankrijnders/MYS-PMS7003.
